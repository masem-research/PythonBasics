    "\n",
    "General structure and comparison with other languages; Overview resources\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Python?** Python is a general-purpose programming language comparable to C+, JavaScript or Microsoft's C' and Oracle's Java\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Development**: Developed by Guido von Rossum in the Netherlands in the 1980s. Named after Monty Python's Flying Circus. In the meantime, however, the *snake proximity* has prevailed.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Popularity**: Python has been among the top 3 most used programming languages on GitHub (TIOBE Programming Community Index) and in Google search (Google: PopularitY of Programming Language Index) for years..  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Some more reasons:**\n",
    "- Python is very flexible and simple --> also easy to learn!\n",
    "- Widespread use in the data science community: On the one hand, *functional* and *procedural* work can be carried out in the analysis of data, while the ability to work *object-oriented* is ideally suited to creating the tools for data science tasks !\n",
    "- DevOps: Usable as a very flexible scripting language (higher level of abstraction, thus faster results)\n",
    "- Available on (almost) all operating systems: Unix, Mac OS, Windows, ... - Official download page: https://www.python.org/downloads/ \n",
    "- Modularisation: Very high number of modules, which allows the basic version to be expanded in almost any direction;\n",
    "- Open Source: No license costs for Python! \n",
    "\n",
    "Python has been maintained by the not-for-profit Python Software Foundation since 2001: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Software_Foundation\n",
    "  \n",
    "   \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Versions\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Python 2**: Since October 2000, but now deprecated (use no longer recommended, Python 2 software should be migrated to Python 3);\n",
    "- **Python 3**: Since December 2008: Major Revision! Not backward compatible; Today, programming should always be done in Python 3;\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differences**:\n",
    "- Python 2: `print 'Hello World'`\n",
    "- Python 3: `print('Hello World')`\n",
    "\n",
    "These small but subtle differences give a good idea of the problems if Python 2 syntax is to be translated into Python 3."
